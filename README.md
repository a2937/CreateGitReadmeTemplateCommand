#CreateGitReadmeTemplateCommand

Tired of seeing and using improper Github readme files, I 
decided to create a command that would create a readme file
right in practically any directory from a template. This template
was created by PurpleBooth in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2).


## Getting Started

In order to use this utility, download the master of this repository. TO edit these files, use any text editor like Notepad++ or Vim. 

### Prerequisites

An operating system that supports batch scripts. 

`
Windows, MacOS, and most Linux distributions
`

### Installing

Extract the NewGitReadme.bat and Readme.md file into a location on your computer.
The preferred file location would be a spot under the Path environment variable so this command can actually be used anywhere. 


Example:
'
D:/NewWindowsCommands
'

In the example, I have made a directory called NewWindowsCommands on my D drive and already added it to the path.
